Cedric himself knew  nothing
whatever about it. 1t had never been
even mentioned to him. He knew that
his papa had been an Englishman,
because his mamma had told him so;
but then his papa had died when he
was 50 litle a boy that he could ot
remember very much about him,
except that he was big. and had blue
eyes and a long mustache, and that it
was a splendid thing to be carried
around the room on his shoulder.
